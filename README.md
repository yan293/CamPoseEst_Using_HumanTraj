# trajCamPose

In this project, we proposed a method to estimated the 3D camera pose (of a static surveillance camera) from 2D pedestrian trajectories.  We have access to a rough estimation of the real camera pose, generate synthetic pedestrian trajectories for training our system, apply the trained system with pedestrian extracted from real surveillance video.
